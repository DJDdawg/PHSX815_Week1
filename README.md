# PHSX815_Week1
Computational Physics class

This class, PHSX 815, is a graduate level course on how to use programming in order to conduct scientific research, analyze data, and obtain results to problems that we are interested in. 

The core bulk of this class is split into the following three components: lecture, homework, and four coding projects. 

Lectures are Tuesday and Thursday at 1300 in Malott Hall, room 2005. Attendence is not mandatory, but is highly encouraged. Zoom recordings for lectures will be made available for students on Canvas should they miss lecture or want to review material given that Professor Rogan does not forget to record the lectures. 

Homeworks will be short and relatively simple for students to complete. Grading for homeworks is based upon completion. Full points will be given to work that is completed on time and appears to have a modicum of effort put into it. These are essentially free points given to the students to incentivize them to stay on pace with the course. Late homeworks will not be accepted.

Projects will be four weeks in length and can be anything that the student desires as long as they fall within the guidelines for each. The topic for each project is encouraged to be relevant to the student's research. The deadline for projects are listed in the course syllabus. All projects are due no later than May 14, with penalties up to 25% for work submitted late. 

There will be no midterm or final for the class.
